My final project is an extension of C and of the topic of data structures discussed in the course. I wrote a class for a general
Binary Tree in C++. It spans almost 300 lines of code across 2 files (.h and .cpp file) and a main file to test it. I implemented
functionality for accessing an element based on its level in the tree and its position in a row, searching whether or not an
element is in the tree, inserting elements, removing elements, printing out the tree in level order, preorder, postorder, or
inorder. But to simplify the user experience I only allow the user to insert, search, remove, and print in level order. I give
instructions for how to use the program at the start of the program. I print each level on different lines but did not make the
traditional isosceles triangle shape for the tree because if the user enters a large number, the shape will be distorted. I decided
to include my source code just in case you would like to see it. To run the program just type './main'. If it does not work, you
can recompile the code by running 'make' (make and g++ compiler are needed for this). Please contact me at sureshyhap@gmail.com
if there are any problems.
